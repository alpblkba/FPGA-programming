# FPGA Programming - CDNC - ITEC - KIT

## Task 1: Digital Design and Simulation
* Analyze a gate-level netlist to determine a secret algebraic function.
* Reproduce the module in Verilog HDL or VHDL.
* Conduct simulation and analysis using a testbench.

## Task 2: Physical Interaction
* Design a state machine with four different states to control onboard LEDs.
* Use switches to toggle between patterns such as blinking and PWM "breathing".
* Calculate counter values for a 125MHz system clock.

## Task 3: Acceleration with SoC
* Integrate a simple ALU into a Zynq Processing System using AXI interfaces.
* Create a block design in Vivado and generate a bitstream.
* Control and test the hardware acceleration using a Jupyter Notebook.
